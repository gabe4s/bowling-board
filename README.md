# Bowling Scoreboard

## About
Bowling scoreboard can help keep track of bowling scores for 1 to 6 players. Frames and players will rotate just like your throws will cause at a bowling alley.

## How to Run
Simply clone the repository and open the index file. The game will then prompt the user to enter the number of players, player names, and scores for each throw.
